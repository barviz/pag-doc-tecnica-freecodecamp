                <p>
                    The Boolean class wraps a value of the primitive type boolean in an object. An object of type
                    Boolean contains a single field whose type is boolean.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, this class provides many methods for converting a boolean to a String and a String to a
                    boolean, as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing with a boolean.

                <p>In addition, this class provides several methods for converting a double to a String and a String to

                <p>The Integer class wraps a value of the primitive type int in an object. An object of type Integer

                <p>Implementation note: The implementations of the "bit twiddling" methods (such as highestOneBit and
                    numberOfTrailingZeros) are based on material from Henry S. Warren, Jr.'s Hacker's Delight, (Addison
                    Wesley, 2002).</p>

                <p>The String class represents character strings. All string literals in Java programs, such as "abc",
                    are implemented as instances of this class.</p>
                <p>Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they are created. String buffers support
                    mutable strings. Because String objects are immutable they can be shared.</p>

                <p>The class String includes methods for examining individual characters of the sequence, for comparing
                    strings, for searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a copy of a string with
                    all characters translated to uppercase or to lowercase. Case mapping is based on the Unicode
                    Standard version specified by the Character class.</p>

                        The class String includes methods for examining individual characters of the sequence, for
                        comparing strings, for searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a copy of
                        a string with all characters translated to uppercase or to lowercase. Case mapping is based on
                        the Unicode Standard version specified by the Character class.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Java language provides special support for the string concatenation operator ( + ), and for
                        conversion of other objects to strings. String concatenation is implemented through the
                        StringBuilder(or StringBuffer) class and its append method. String conversions are implemented
                        through the method toString, defined by Object and inherited by all classes in Java. For
                        additional information on string concatenation and conversion, see Gosling, Joy, and Steele, The
                        Java Language Specification.</li>
                    <li>
                        Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in this class will
                        cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.
                    </li>
                    <li>A String represents a string in the UTF-16 format in which supplementary characters are
                        represented by surrogate pairs (see the section Unicode Character Representations in the
                        Character class for more information). Index values refer to char code units, so a supplementary
                        character uses two positions in a String.</li>
                    <li>
                        The String class provides methods for dealing with Unicode code points (i.e., characters), in
                        addition to those for dealing with Unicode code units (i.e., char values).
